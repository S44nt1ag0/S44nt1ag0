# Hello üëã

I currently work in the tech industry as a back-end and front-end developer, with a strong focus on software architecture and best development practices. I have solid experience in building RESTful APIs, following patterns such as MVC, DDD, and other principles of scalable and maintainable design. I develop robust systems, integrate with external services, and structure complete web solutions‚Äîranging from small applications to large-scale platforms.
